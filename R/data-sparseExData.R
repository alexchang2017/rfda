#' example data: sparse
#'
#' This data is simulated. It is come from a random design, 200 subjects with 1 to 8
#' measurements on each subject. Time interval is [0,10]. The number of measurements
#' for each subject is uniformly distributed on {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. The timepoints for
#' each subject are uniformly distributed on [0,10]. The number of true principal
#' components is 2. One is N(0,9) and another one follows N(0,4).
#' The true mean function: t+sin(t). The two eigenfunctions are -sqrt(0.2)*cos(2*t*pi/10) and
#' sqrt0.2)*sin(2*t*pi/10), respectively. The measurement error follows standard normal distribution.

#' @format A data.frame with 926 observations on 3 variables.
