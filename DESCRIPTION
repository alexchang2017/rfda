Description: This package provides the tools to perform the functional
    data analysis. The core of this package is functional principal componet
    analysis (FPCA) based on the principal analysis by conditional estimation
    (PACE) algorithm mainly developed by H.G. Muller. The multivariate part with
    normalization are done primarily by J.M. Chiou, Y.F Yang, and Y.T. Chen (See
    References). In addition, this package provides the another normalization
    approach (with quantiles) in multivariate FPCA. This package is mostly based
    on the MatLab package, PACE, released at http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/PACE/.
    Besides, some ideas are borrowed from the R package, fdapace. This package,
    rfda, provides R approach for FPCA based on PACE 2.17 and use the C++ linear
    algebra library, Armadillo, and the C++ multi-threaded implementation with
    RcppArmadillo and RcppParallel. Note: Since the BLAS used by RcppArmadillo
    is based on what BLAS R links to, so this package will be more efficient if a
    powerful BLAS used by R.
